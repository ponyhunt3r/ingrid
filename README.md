# Ingrid Recruitment Exercise

Basic currency coverter, based on create-creact-app

## Starting the app

Run cmd.exe, go into project dir, install dependencies with: `npm run i`

After successfull installation run:
`npm run start`

Visit the app: http://localhost:3000

## TODO

Things, that I didn't manage to finish in time, but should be there:

- Tests
- Proper error handling (showing alerts isn't very user-friendly)
- The dates in date range should not allow the end date be earlier than start date
- There should be additional check if the identical date range has been already fetched in previous request
- Proper state managment, so components could be easily divided into smaller parts without passing the props
- App is usable on mobile, but could look prettier
